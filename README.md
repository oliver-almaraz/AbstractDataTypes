# Abstract Data Types
Header files, source code and examples for abstract datatypes implemented entirely in C.

I created these libraries a while ago for learning data structures and their public interfaces.
They had been lying around among other long-forgotten, unfinished projects until I recently started programming again.
Since some of my new projects require the use of some of the abstract datatypes for which I had already written some libs, I committed myself to writing cleaner, simpler and self-explaining versions to make them a lot easier to include and use.

Since these libraries were made for my own personal use, I often **preferred simplicity over abstraction**. You therefore might need to modify these libs to either make them match your specific implementation or to make them more abstract, if you consider it's worth the hassle.
However, I trust they will be adequate for most of the implementations out there.

I used as references for writing these libraries mainly Kyle Loudon's **"Mastering Algorithms with C"** and Richard Reese's **"Understanding and Using C Pointers"**, both published by O'Reilly & Associates.
